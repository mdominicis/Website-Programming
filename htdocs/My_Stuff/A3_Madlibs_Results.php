You quickly make an appointment with your <span class=red>$_POST[adj2]</span> counselor, Mrs. <span class=red>$_POST[fruit]</span>, to get your class changed.  You are told that there is not a chance in <span class=red>$_POST[place]</span>'s big <span class=red>$_POST[color]</span> mountains that you are getting out of this class.  You decide to fake being sick with the <span class=red>$_POST[body]</span> flu, but no one believes you.   Nurse <span class=red>$_POST[obj]</span> tells you to take yourself and your <span class=red>$_POST[obj2]</span> and get back to class and start working.</div><br>";
